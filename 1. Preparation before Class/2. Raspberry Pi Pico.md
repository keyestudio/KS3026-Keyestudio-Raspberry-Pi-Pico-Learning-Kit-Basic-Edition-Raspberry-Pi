# **Raspberry Pi Pico Board：**

### **1. Introduction：**

Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces. 

It integrates the RP2040 microcontroller chip designed by Raspberry Pi, with dual-core Arm Cortex M0+ processor running up to 133 MHz, embedded 264KB of SRAM and 2MB of on-board Flash memory, as well as 26 multi-function GPIO pins. 

For software development, either Raspberry Pi's C/C++ SDK, or the MicroPython is available. In this tutorial, we will use MicroPython.
